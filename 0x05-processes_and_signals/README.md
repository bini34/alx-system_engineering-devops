# ALX System Engineering and DevOps - Processes and Signals

## Overview

This repository contains a set of Bash scripts and a C program designed to explore and understand processes and signals in a Unix-like environment. The tasks cover various aspects such as process identification, process listing, signal handling, and managing processes.

## Project Details

- **Project Name:** Processes and Signals
- **Author:** Sylvain Kalache
- **Weight:** 1
- **Project Status:** Ongoing second chance project
- **Start Date:** Dec 22, 2023 6:00 AM
- **End Date:** Dec 26, 2023 6:00 AM
- **Auto Review:** Scheduled at the deadline

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

### General
- Understand what a PID is.
- Identify and explain what a process is.
- Find a process' PID.
- Terminate a process using signals.
- Comprehend the concept of signals in Linux.

### Bash Scripting
- Write Bash scripts for process-related tasks.
- Use system calls for process management.
- Handle signals in Bash scripts.
- Develop scripts that adhere to best practices and coding standards.
