## Web Infrastructure Design README

Welcome to our Web Infrastructure Design project!.

### Project Overview

In this project, we will be focusing on designing various web infrastructures, ranging from simple setups to more complex distributed systems. Each task will build upon the previous one, covering essential concepts in web infrastructure design, such as server setup, load balancing, security, and monitoring.

### Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will gain the following knowledge and skills:

- Understanding of DNS, monitoring, web servers, and network basics.
- Ability to explain the components and functionality of a web stack.
- Knowledge of system redundancy and high availability concepts.
- Familiarity with HTTPS, firewalls, and load balancers.
- Proficiency in drawing diagrams to represent web infrastructures.

### Tasks Overview

1. **Simple Web Stack**:
   - Design a one-server web infrastructure with a LAMP stack.
   - Explain the roles of the server, domain name, web server, application server, and database.
   - Identify issues such as SPOF and downtime during maintenance.

2. **Distributed Web Infrastructure**:
   - Design a three-server web infrastructure with load balancing.
   - Explain the addition of elements like servers, load balancer, and database cluster.
   - Discuss issues related to SPOF, security, and monitoring.

3. **Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure**:
   - Design a secured and monitored web infrastructure.
   - Include firewalls, SSL certificate, and monitoring clients.
   - Address issues regarding SSL termination, database redundancy, and component diversity.

4. **Scale Up (Advanced)**:
   - Differentiate between application server and web server.
   - Implement a clustered load balancer setup with split components.
   - Justify the addition of each element in the infrastructure.
