Task 0

Server:
A server is a computer system that provides services or resources to other computers or devices over a network.

Domain Name:
- The domain name serves as a human-readable label that corresponds to the server's IP address.
- It allows users to access the website by typing a memorable name (like www.foobar.com) instead of the IP address.
DNS Record for "www":
- The DNS record for "www" in www.foobar.com is a CNAME record.
- It acts as an alias, directing requests for the "www" subdomain to the server's IP address.
Web Server (Nginx):
- The web server (Nginx) handles incoming HTTP requests from users and serves static and dynamic content.
Application Server:
- The application server executes the application codebase (e.g., PHP) and processes dynamic requests.
- It handles user authentication, database interactions, and other application-specific tasks.
Database (MySQL):
- The database (MySQL) stores and manages the website's data.
- It allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of structured data.
Server Communication with User's Computer:
- The server communicates with the user's computer using the HTTP protocol.
- When a user requests a webpage, their browser sends an HTTP request to the server, which responds with the requested content.
              Issues with this Infrastructure:
Single Point of Failure (SPOF):
- Since there's only one server, any failure in hardware or software could result in downtime for the entire website.
Downtime during Maintenance:
- When maintenance is needed, such as deploying new code or restarting the web server, the website may experience downtime, causing inconvenience to users.
Limited Scalability:
- The infrastructure may struggle to handle large spikes in incoming traffic since there's only one server.
- Scaling horizontally (adding more servers) would require redesigning the architecture for better scalability and fault tolerance.
