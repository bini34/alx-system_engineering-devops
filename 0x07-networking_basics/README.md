# Networking Basics #0 - DevOps Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Networking Basics #0 project in the DevOps curriculum. This project, created by Sylvain Kalache, focuses on fundamental networking concepts that are essential for anyone entering the field of DevOps. The project spans various topics, including the OSI model, types of networks, MAC and IP addresses, TCP and UDP protocols, and more.

### Project Schedule

- Project Start: Jan 3, 2024, 6:00 AM
- Project Deadline: Jan 5, 2024, 6:00 AM
- Checker Release: Jan 5, 2024, 6:00 AM
- Auto Review: Scheduled at the deadline

### Resources

To successfully complete this project, it is recommended to read or watch materials on the following topics:

- OSI model
- Different types of networks
- LAN and WAN networks
- Internet
- MAC address
- IP address (IPv4 and IPv6)
- Localhost
- TCP and UDP
- TCP/UDP ports list
- Ping/ICMP
- Positional parameters

Additionally, familiarize yourself with the following commands:

- `netstat`
- `ping`

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without external assistance:

- OSI Model: Understand its purpose, layers, and organization.
- Types of Networks: Differentiate between LAN, WAN, and the Internet.
- MAC and IP Addresses: Comprehend their roles and distinctions.
- TCP and UDP: Grasp the main differences between these data transfer protocols.
- TCP/UDP Ports: Memorize key port numbers for SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS.
- Ping/ICMP: Understand their use in checking device connectivity.

### Copyright and Plagiarism
